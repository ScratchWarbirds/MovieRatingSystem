Reflection Questions:
Nested if statements are bad practice and can be comfusing to read. Ifs only exicute code if true while else if will look for another condition.
Switches are neater to read and less confusing to mess up than multiple if statements.
Conditional Operators to me is just an easier way to write else if
short-circuit make if statements easier to write in one line instead of nesting ifs. Also helps include rarities or odd conditions.
